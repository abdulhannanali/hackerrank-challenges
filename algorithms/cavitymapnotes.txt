using integer two dimensional array will be probably a good choice to solving this problem. 


// two dimensional integer array with n x n cells so it will be
int[][] intArray = new int[i][j]; where i = n and j = n 

fill them with numbers


for the sake of our example cavities will be denoted as Integer.MIN_VALUE after their detection
first checking cavities.

if any of their index is j - 1 i - 1 or 0 they are not cavities

printing the integer array and printing the X in place of the cavities if any.

Integer.MIN_VALUE

let's get coding
