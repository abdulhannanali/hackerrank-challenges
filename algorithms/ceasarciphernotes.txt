I have a text which is abhjz and K = 4

fglnh

pseudocode for the problem
converting the string to character

determining whether the given char is an alphabet (isAlphabet()) method might be helpful

if it's lowerCase or upperCase 
if upperCase subtractive charValue() of 'A' other wise subtracting the charValue of 'a'.

using the formula to calculate the position of the character in the newSTring
(position of the current character + K) % 25 where lengthOfAlphabets starting from 0 will be 25. 

after this factory working add 'A' or 'a'.

iterate this process for every character
convert the array to string

wallah!
